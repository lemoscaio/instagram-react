<h2 align=center>Instagram Mock Website</h2>
<h3 align=center>Web development Project</h3>
<hr>
<h4>A mock website of the original <a href="[http://](https://www.instagram.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instagram.com</a>, made with React.JS. This was the seventh project of the Driven full stack web development bootcamp and the first to use React.JS.</h4>
<h4>Since this was the first project to use React.JS, the goal was to simply recreate the second project of the Bootcamp, but using only React.JS instead of HTML and CSS. This is <b>not a working site</b>.</h4>
